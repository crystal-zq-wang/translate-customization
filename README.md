# translate-customization
Customizing Google Translate translations based on gender, status, respect levels between speaker and addressee(s).
Tentative: primarily focusing on gender + respect from English to Hindi

Hindi-specific notes; will update later about gender, plurals, possessives:
आप (aap) - you (polite, usually to a stranger)
तुम (tum) - you (informal)
तू (too) - you (intimate)
